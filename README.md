# TranscribeTool

This is the tool I use to transcribe the audio recordings of my lectures.

Drag the audio into the tank.

 - `Ctrl`+`S` to Save as text file (Saves progress into audio too)
 - `Ctrl`+`O` to Open text file (Only open files that you previously saved with this app... hehe app)
 - `Ctrl`+`SPACE` to play/pause audio
 - `Ctrl`+`Left` to skip back 5 seconds
 - `Ctrl`+`Right` to skip forward 5 seconds
